Project 1: Digit Classification with KNN and Naive Bayes

In this project, you'll implement your own image recognition system for classifying digits. Read through the code and the instructions carefully and add your own code where indicated. Each problem can be addressed succinctly with the included packages -- please don't add any more. Grading will be based on writing clean, commented code, along with a few short answers.

As always, you're welcome to work on the project in groups and discuss ideas on the course wall, but  please prepare your own write-up (with your own code).
